She has gained notoriety in the corporate world for being able to handle serious situations and the most difficult requests without guilt.

Created by Umbrella Europe's No. 6 Laboratory, the Nemesis-T Types were the culmination of the Nemesis Project with the successful implantation of NE-Î± parasites within T-103 hosts, presenting Umbrella with a highly intelligent and powerful creature. Several Nemesis-T Types were produced, though only one - Nemesis-T02 - is known to have experienced combat. This individual was sent in Raccoon City and nicknamed the "Pursuer".</p>
